Demo-CICD-GitHub: Privacy policy

  Welcome to the Demo-CICD-GitHub app for Android!

  This is an open source Android app developed by veera to demonstrate the CI CD pipeline. The source code is available on GitHub. 

  As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

  I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
  All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
